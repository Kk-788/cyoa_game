Objective: Retrieve the legendary treasure hidden deep within the Whispering
Caverns. Beware — not all who seek it return.

1. The Fork in the Forest

You stand at a fork in the trail deep within the ancient Bramblewood Forest.
The left path winds into a misty thicket, where silver fog weaves through
trees like ghosts. The right path leads toward a craggy hill with a dark cave
mouth yawning like an open jaw.

A crow caws above you, startling you. You mutter to yourself, "Left or right...
What did the old map say again?" The wind offers no answer. Somewhere out
there lies the treasure of the Whispering Caverns — and the first step is yours.

a) Go left into the misty woods
b) Go right toward the cave
