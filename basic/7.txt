7. Spirit’s Blessing

The spirit leads you effortlessly through the woods, where the mist parts 
at her presence. “Most never find the true path,” she says. “But you are 
different.” Before long, you find yourself standing before the hidden 
entrance of the cavern — not the cave you saw before, but one buried beneath 
ivy and stone.

“Follow the markings,” she whispers. “But beware the serpent — it always 
lies.” She fades into the air like morning dew, leaving behind only a strange warmth in your chest.

a) Enter the cavern with the spirit’s guidance in mind
b) Thank the spirit and go alone through the original entrance
