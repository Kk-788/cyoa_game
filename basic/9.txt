9. Sun Tunnel

You step into a bright chamber. Golden beams shine from cracks in the ceiling. 
A pedestal stands in the center, holding an ornate chest. But blocking your 
way is a stone slab etched with a riddle:

"I have cities but no houses, rivers but no water, and forests but no trees. 
What am I?"

You frown. “A riddle. Classic.” The chamber begins to shake, dust falling from 
the ceiling. You don’t have much time.

a) Answer: “A map”
b) Guess randomly: “A ghost?”
