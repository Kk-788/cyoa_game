6. Deeper Cavern

The lantern’s eerie flame lights the tunnel ahead. Strange symbols glow 
faintly on the stone walls—sunbursts, coiled snakes, and spiraling stars. 
Soon, you reach a chamber with two passages. One is marked with a golden 
sun, the other with a green serpent coiled around a skull.

You speak aloud to steady your nerves. “Sun or serpent… One leads to 
treasure, the other to doom.” The air in the sun tunnel is dry and warm; 
the serpent tunnel exhales a foul-smelling draft. You grip the lantern tighter.

a) Enter the sun-marked tunnel
