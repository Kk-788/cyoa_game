8. Cursed

You panic and bolt through the trees. The ghost screams behind you — not in 
anger, but in pain. “Fool!” she cries. “You’ve doomed yourself!”

Branches slash your arms as the forest seems to close in around you. No matter 
which way you run, the mist thickens. Days pass. Your compass spins wildly. 
The forest twists and reshapes — and you begin to forget why you came here at all.

The End
