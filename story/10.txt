10. Serpent’s Trap

You follow the serpent path into a tunnel that coils downward like a spiral. 
The walls are slick and smell of rot. Suddenly, the floor drops. You tumble 
into a pit filled with bones and flickering green torches.

From the shadows, hundreds of snakes slither toward you, eyes glowing. 
"No, no, no—" you whisper, scrambling. But the walls are too steep, and the
snakes too fast.
