2. Misty Woods

As you push through the mist, the air grows colder, damp with the scent of 
moss and something older. Every footstep is muffled by the thick fog that 
curls around your boots. Behind you, you hear a twig snap — then another. 
You're not alone.

Suddenly, a glowing blue orb floats ahead, weaving slowly between the trees. 
It pulses gently, almost like it’s breathing. A whisper tickles your ear: 
"Follow..." You freeze. "Who’s there?" you say aloud, but no one responds —
just the sound of distant wind.

a) Follow the glowing orb -> 4
b) Hide and wait to see what happens -> 5
