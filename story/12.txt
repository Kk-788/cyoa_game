12. Treasure Room

Your voice rings out. “A map.” The stone slab slides aside, revealing the 
treasure chest. You step forward, breath caught in your throat, and open it. 
Inside: ancient coins, jeweled goblets, and a scroll inscribed with a 
forgotten language.

As you lift the treasure, a warm light fills the room. The ghostly voice 
returns: “You were wise, and brave. Let your name be remembered.” You smile, 
victorious.

The End
