4. Spirit Guide

The orb morphs before your eyes into a ghostly woman in a tattered cloak. 
Her face is kind but sad, and her eyes shimmer like stars. “You seek the 
treasure,” she says softly. “But not all who seek it deserve it. Do you?”

You hesitate. “I... I think so. I just want to find the truth.”

She studies you, then nods. “I will help you, if your intentions remain pure.” 
The spirit floats forward, motioning for you to follow. A hidden path opens 
through the trees, leading you back toward the cavern.

a) Accept the spirit's help -> 7
b) Run away from the ghost -> 8
