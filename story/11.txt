11. The Safe Path

You step back from the cave. Maybe this isn’t your journey. Maybe some 
treasures are best left buried. You make your way home with the wind at 
your back and the forest whispering behind you.

Years later, you’ll wonder what might’ve happened if you’d gone in. But 
you’ll also know this: you lived. And sometimes, that’s enough.

The End
