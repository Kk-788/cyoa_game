3. Cave Entrance

The cave breathes a chill into your face as you step near. Just inside the 
entrance, an old iron lantern lies beside a crumpled skeleton, clutching 
a rusted dagger. You shiver. The tunnel beyond stretches into darkness, 
its stone walls covered in ancient carvings.

"Well, no turning back," you murmur, picking up the lantern. It flares to
life unexpectedly, glowing with a blue flame. "Creepy... but useful."

The air is heavy here, but something deeper in the cave seems to call you.

a) Take the lantern and go deeper -> 6
b) Turn backâ€”this seems dangerous -> 11
