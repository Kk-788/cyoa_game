5. Ambush!

You crouch behind a tree, heart pounding. The footsteps grow louder—
then suddenly, silence. Before you can react, a blade presses against 
your throat. "Nice try," a gruff voice says. You’re yanked to your feet
by forest bandits dressed in patchwork armor.

"Looks like we caught us a little explorer," sneers another, rifling through
your bag. They strip you of your gear and leave you tied to a tree. Hours 
pass. Night falls. No one comes. You are utterly alone.

The End
